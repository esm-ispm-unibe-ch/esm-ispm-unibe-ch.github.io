The "Evidence Synthesis Methods" research group focuses on methods for synthesizing evidence from studies about the efficacy and safety of healthcare interventions. We develop, advance, apply and disseminate methodology for pairwise and network meta-analysis. Our work includes research on methods to address publication bias, the role of non-randomized studies in evidence synthesis, multivariate meta-analysis models and methods to synthesize data about rare safety outcomes. 

Our team has long-standing expertise on network meta-analysis. Traditional meta-analytical methods commonly used for synthesizing evidence from clinical trials are limited in comparing two interventions. However, for any given condition there is usually a plethora of alternative treatment options; this situation has motivated the development of network meta-analysis techniques, which extent usual pairwise meta-analysis for the case when more than two treatments are being compared in the available trials.
